Form validation - the idea is to set the form first, create the necessary fields and add the styling. Then implement the more technical features on top as much of the requirements allow.

## TODOs

- Validation of all the input fields
- Conditional rule for the `Tiger` field

## Requirements

- `Email` must be a valid email address.
- `Password` must be longer than 8 characters.
- `Colour` is multichoice, where only one option may be selected, and the options are `Blue`, `Green`, `Red`, `Black` and `Brown`.
- `Animals` is multichoice, where multiple options can be selected, and the options are `Bear`, `Tiger`, `Snake`, and `Donkey`.
- If `Tiger` is selected then a textbox `Type of tiger` is revealed and this is a required field.
